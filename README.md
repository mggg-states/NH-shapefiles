# NH-shapefiles
This shapefile was obtained from NH Granit: New Hampshire’s Statewide GIS Clearinghouse. 2012-2018 data were processed by students in Diana Davis' Districting Data REU: Sara Asgari, Quinn Basewitz, Ethan Bergmann, Jack Brogsol, Martina Kampel, Becca Keating, and Dylan Torrance. 2020 data were processed by collaborator Bill Brown from Hanover, NH. Some additional processing was done by MGGG staff.

## Sources
The New Hampshire precinct shapefile was obtained from [NH Granit: New Hampshire’s Statewide GIS Clearinghouse](www.granit.unh.edu/data/downloadfreedata/downloaddata.html), a GIS service of the State of New Hampshire. Election data come from the [New Hampshire Secretary of State](https://sos.nh.gov/elections/elections/election-results/). 2010 Decennial Census demographic data were downloaded from the [Census API](https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1). The 2010 census block shapefile for New Hampshire was downloaded from the US Census Bureau’s [TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html).


## Processing
Some very limited merging of precincts in the tabular election data and precinct shapefile were necessary to join election results to precinct boundaries. Demographic data were aggregated from the block level using MGGG’s proration software. Congressional and state legislative district IDs were also assigned to precincts using this package.
